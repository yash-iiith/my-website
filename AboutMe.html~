<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><img src="./yash1.jpg" alt="me again">I come from Jhansi. At the age of 19 years, all I dream about is a successful and settled + 'happy' life ahead. As I was good in Mathematics in high school, I opted for Mathematics in +2 I worked during my intermediate to get into the IITs. But,I couldn't get into any of the IITs,so I decided to give it another try and went to "The Coaching Hub"-Kota.My result improved and i got a seat in IIT but luckily i also got selected in IIITH which was my dreamplace ever since i came to know about it.Thank God, I landed 'here' at IIIT, Hyderabad. I am highly interested in everything that matters to me, various activities that surround my daily life and always up for new experiences. I love spending time with myself. I believe that everything happens for good, and for a purpose, according to what one deserves. I wish to be a better human being and move on and on in life, learning new things everyday by accepting that has already happened. For the only aim to grasp knowledge, I now lead a new life in a new city with new people and new environment.</p>
